"What? Where? When?" is an intellectual game, quiz-show in which a team of six players, called "experts", looks for the right answers to different questions by means of brainstorming. Time limit is one minute. The WWW movement is widely developed all around the world, including our (and your)) place of residence.
The core of the project is the website of the Cherkassy Club "What? Where? When?".
Here you can check the list of teams, players and tournaments, get acquainted with them and even check their statistics! Didn't manage to find your team or its results? Add them manually! :)
